The **Bridge Pattern** is a structural design pattern that is used to separate abstraction from implementation. This pattern allows both the abstraction and the implementation to evolve independently. It is particularly useful when you want to avoid a rigid class hierarchy.

In Java, the Bridge pattern is typically used to decouple the abstraction from its implementation so that both can vary independently without affecting each other.

### Components of the Bridge Pattern:

1.  **Abstraction**: This defines the abstraction interface and holds a reference to an object of type `Implementor`.
2.  **Refined Abstraction**: This extends the `Abstraction` class and can provide additional functionality if needed.
3.  **Implementor**: This defines the interface for the implementation class.
4.  **ConcreteImplementor**: This implements the `Implementor` interface.


### Explanation:

1.  **Color (Implementor)**: This interface defines a method `fill()`, which is implemented by the `RedColor` and `BlueColor` classes.
2.  **Shape (Abstraction)**: This is an abstract class that holds a reference to the `Color` object. It defines an abstract `draw()` method.
3.  **Circle and Square (Refined Abstraction)**: These classes extend `Shape` and provide their own implementation of the `draw()` method.
4.  **BridgePatternExample (Client)**: This is the client code that creates objects and uses the `Shape` interface to draw shapes with different colors.

### Benefits of the Bridge Pattern:

-   **Decouples Abstraction and Implementation**: The implementation details can be changed without affecting the abstraction.
-   **Improves Flexibility**: You can add new abstraction and implementation classes independently.
-   **Reduces Complexity**: Avoids a large inheritance hierarchy by splitting the abstraction and implementation into separate class hierarchies.
